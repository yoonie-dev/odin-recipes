    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Let’s make baechujeon, Korean cabbage pancake! It’s easy, fast, simple and cheap and most of all you will be surprised how good it tastes!</p>
    <p>To make this pancake more delicious, make a delicious batter with good stock. A cabbage by itself will be slightly crispy and sweet, which is good, but the taste is enhanced with a good batter, which is why I never skip it. I sometimes use vegetable stock and sometimes anchovy kelp stock, and this time I used some of my homemade vegetable stock that I had frozen. You also can use beef or chicken broth. The batter should be thin and a little runny: if it’s too thick it will clump, so the ratio is important. Be sure to use up all the batter. Be sure to use a generous amount of cooking oil so the pancake will be crunchy. And as soon as it’s cooked it should be served, because even 5 to 10 minutes later it will be a little soggy.</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces napa cabbage leaves (4 to 5 leaves), washed, pat dried, with a few slits at the bottom so they lay flat</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for cooking</li>
        <li>1 cup stock (vegetable stock, anchovy-kelp stock, or chicken broth)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>⅔ cup all purpose-flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon gochu-garu (Korean hot pepper flakes)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Make the sauce: Combine the soy sauce, gochu-garu, vinegar, green onion, and sesame seeds in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the batter: Combine the stock, salt, flour, and the egg in a large bowl. Mix together well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fry the cabbage leaves: Heat up some vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Swirl to coat evenly. Dip a cabbage leaf into the batter, making sure to coat the whole leaf. Place it in the skillet. Repeat with another leaf.
            </li>
            <li>
                With a spatula, press down on the slitted white parts of the leaves for about 10 seconds to flatten them out. Cook until lightly crisped on the bottom, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip and add more oil if necessary. Cook another 2 minutes, until the other side is lightly crisp, too.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, until both sides are crisp but not brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer to a plate and serve right away with the dipping sauce. Work in batches with the rest of cabbage and the batter.
