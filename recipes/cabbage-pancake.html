    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Let’s make baechujeon, Korean cabbage pancake! It’s easy, fast, simple and cheap and most of all you will be surprised how good it tastes!</p>
    <p>To make this pancake more delicious, make a delicious batter with good stock. A cabbage by itself will be slightly crispy and sweet, which is good, but the taste is enhanced with a good batter, which is why I never skip it. I sometimes use vegetable stock and sometimes anchovy kelp stock, and this time I used some of my homemade vegetable stock that I had frozen. You also can use beef or chicken broth. The batter should be thin and a little runny: if it’s too thick it will clump, so the ratio is important. Be sure to use up all the batter. Be sure to use a generous amount of cooking oil so the pancake will be crunchy. And as soon as it’s cooked it should be served, because even 5 to 10 minutes later it will be a little soggy.</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>8 ounces napa cabbage leaves (4 to 5 leaves), washed, pat dried, with a few slits at the bottom so they lay flat</li>
