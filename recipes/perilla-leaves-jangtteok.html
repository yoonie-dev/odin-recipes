    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is called kkaennip-jangtteok, a kind of pancake. What makes it special is the tasty batter seasoned with Korean fermented soybean paste (doenjang), hot pepper paste (gochujang), fish sauce, or soy sauce, which are Korean fermented pastes and sauces (jang) hence the name “jangtteok.” This jangtteok is savory, earthy, a little spicy, a little minty, and crisp on the outside and soft and chewy (like Korean rice cakes, or tteok) on the inside.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>30 medium size perilla leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons doenjang (Korean fermented soybean paste)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean fermented hot pepper paste)</li>
            <li>¼ cup sliced onion</li>
            <li>1 green chili pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil (or any cooking oil will be ok)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine the flour, soybean paste, hot pepper paste, and 1 cup water in a bowl. Mix well with a spoon or whisk until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the perilla leaves, onion, and green chili pepper. Mix well with a spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet (preferably 12-inch) over medium heat. Swirl the oil to coat the skillet evenly. If your skillet is smaller, you may need to work in batches.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the mixture into the skillet and shape it into a 12-inch circle. Cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes until the bottom turns golden brown and crispy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a spatula to carefully flip it over and press it down gently. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for an additional 3 minutes until both sides are golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip it over one more time and cook for an extra minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer it to a cutting board and let it cool for 5 minutes. Then, cut it into bite-sized rectangular pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve as a side dish for rice. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Enjoy!
