    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is called kkaennip-jangtteok, a kind of pancake. What makes it special is the tasty batter seasoned with Korean fermented soybean paste (doenjang), hot pepper paste (gochujang), fish sauce, or soy sauce, which are Korean fermented pastes and sauces (jang) hence the name “jangtteok.” This jangtteok is savory, earthy, a little spicy, a little minty, and crisp on the outside and soft and chewy (like Korean rice cakes, or tteok) on the inside.</p>
