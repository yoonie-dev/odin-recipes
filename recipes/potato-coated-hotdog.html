    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Today I’m going to show you some fun Korean street food: a hot dog on a stick with french fries! In Korean we call this a gamja-hotdog. “Hotdog” because in Korea the American-style hot dog of a wiener in a bun is not usual. Our “hotdogs” are on sticks coated with batter and deep fried, similar to what Americans call a “corn dog” but unlike American corn dogs its not made with cornmeal batter.</p>
    <p>The street vendors of Korea sell many kind of hot dogs on a stick, but this is my favorite version. Some of them have cheese inside, and some have a wiener and cheese, but this version has tiny pieces of potato embedded in the batter! So you get a sausage covered with delicious, fluffy dough, and then crunchy french fries on the outside. This gamja-hotdog is very big! So if you have one of these with a glass of milk it’s a simple meal.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white or brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 package dry yeast (about 2 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1¾ cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 uncured beef hot dogs, pat dried</li>
        <li>4 disposable wooden chopsticks</li>
        <li>1 pound peeled potato, cut into ¼ inch small cubes, rinsed and soaked in cold water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all purpose wheat flour</li>
        <li>½ cup Korean bread crumbs (ppang-garu) or Japanese panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>corn or vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>sugar, ketchup, and yellow mustard (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine the warm water and sugar in a bowl. Stir well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the active dry yeast and let it sit for a few minutes until the yeast melts.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the salt and flour. Mix well with a wooden spoon for about 2 minutes until it turns smooth without any lumps at all.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover and let it sit until the volume doubles in size, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Boil a quart of water in a pan. Drain the potato and add it to the boiling water. Blanch for 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain the potato and rinse in cold running water to remove any excess starch.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain the potato and dry out out the pieces with a cotton cloth or paper towel.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the potato into a bowl and mix with 2 tablespoons flour. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Skewer the hot dogs on skewers or wooden chopsticks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 4 inches of oil in a large frying pan or wok to 320°F- 330°F. The pan should be deep and wide enough to immerse at least one hot dog plus the stick. If you don’t have kitchen thermometer, use a wooden chopstick to dip a bit of dough into the oil. If it bubbles vigorously, it’s ready to fry!
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the diced potato on your cutting board next to your bread crumbs and your batter, all in a row. Coat a hot dog skewer with the batter, turning the skewer around so it’s fully covered. You can use your hands to shape it a bit, if you need to! Then roll it in the potato bits, and pack them into the batter a bit with your hands, until they stick. Then roll it in the breadcrumbs until it’s completely covered before dropping the battered dog into the hot oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry for 6 to 7 minutes and use tongs to take it out. Repeat with all of your hot dog skewers.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can garnish as you like, but Korean street vendors lightly dust each hot dog in sugar, and then drizzle both ketchup and yellow mustard over top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve and eat right away!
