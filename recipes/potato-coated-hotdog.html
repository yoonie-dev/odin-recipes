    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Today I’m going to show you some fun Korean street food: a hot dog on a stick with french fries! In Korean we call this a gamja-hotdog. “Hotdog” because in Korea the American-style hot dog of a wiener in a bun is not usual. Our “hotdogs” are on sticks coated with batter and deep fried, similar to what Americans call a “corn dog” but unlike American corn dogs its not made with cornmeal batter.</p>
    <p>The street vendors of Korea sell many kind of hot dogs on a stick, but this is my favorite version. Some of them have cheese inside, and some have a wiener and cheese, but this version has tiny pieces of potato embedded in the batter! So you get a sausage covered with delicious, fluffy dough, and then crunchy french fries on the outside. This gamja-hotdog is very big! So if you have one of these with a glass of milk it’s a simple meal.</p>
